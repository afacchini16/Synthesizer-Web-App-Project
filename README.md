## Description
Synth Lord is a web based [synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer) with MIDI support. Heroku currently does not support MIDI so in order to use your MIDI controller you must run the app locally by following the steps below.

NOTE: Synth Lord has only been tested for Google Chrome compatibility so other browsers may not function as expected.

## Installation

2. Change directory to the project folder in terminal.

3. Run 'npm install'

4. Run 'node server.js'

5. Open 'http://localhost:8000/' in browser.

## Issues/Bugs

The page must be reloaded every time one of the settings from the Tuna effects library is changed, or else there is a significant spike in CPU usage (this has something to do with the WAD library we used).

Drum loops stop playing when the page is reloaded after setting change.

Drum pad buttons spike CPU usage.

MIDI support currently not working with Heroku deployment.
